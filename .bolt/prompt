LabLink’s doctrine in plain terms: never write code unless it respects the real schema, RLS, Supabase auth, and React Query lifecycles—period. Everything is versioned, migrations are mandatory, and logic lives in exactly one place. Marketplace data only exists if all visibility conditions are met; lab requests are one-per-order, enforced by DB constraints and transactions. The email/auth flow is fixed—frontend validation, backend check, deterministic UI routing, no OAuth duplicates, no redirect loops. Every screen has explicit states, every API response is typed and explicit, notifications fire only after DB writes, and audits are non-optional. Performance, mobile UX, and security are first-class citizens. If a change breaks RLS, duplicates logic, fetches before auth, creates ghost data, introduces inconsistent states, hides errors, or isn’t versioned—it’s rejected, no debate.
